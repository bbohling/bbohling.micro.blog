For the last few weeks after my son’s piano lessons we go to a particular restaurant. Only the piano lesson is a calendar event; nothing about the restaurant on my iPhone. Last night driving away from piano lessons, an iOS notification popped up stating how long until we arrive at the restaurant. Interesting. Too bad Apple can’t make basic text input easier...I swear my typing accuracy has gotten worse with every release since the original iPhone.
