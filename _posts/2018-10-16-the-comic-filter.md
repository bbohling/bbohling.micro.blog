The comic filter that [@gruber](https://micro.blog/gruber) and others were discussing on Twitter yesterday is so simple to use: 

* Go to iMessages
* Click camera to left of text box
* Click on star icon
* Click on three-circle icon
* Click on filter to right of original
* Click X
* Take photo
* Click Done
*  It takes you back to iMessages
*  Click X to remove photo from text box
*  Photo is saved to Photos

Simple, right!?
