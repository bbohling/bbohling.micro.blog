Well, Indiepaper builds on top of <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> building blocks, namely <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">micropub</a>. To use Indiepaper from your app, just send an HTTP POST request to Indiepaper with a <code>Authorization</code> header containing a bearer token for your micropub endpoint, and a <code>x-indiepaper-destination</code> header containing the URL for your micropub endpoint. Your POST request should pass the variable &quot;url&quot; as form-encoded data. Optionally, you can pass the variable &quot;category&quot; as form-encoded data to specify a category for the saved content. Note: the &quot;category&quot; parameter can be passed multiple times if you want to specify multiple categories. </p> <p> For example, if you wanted to save <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509888/oumuamua-interstellar-comet-asteroid-solar-system-trajectory">this interesting article from The Verge</a> to your read later channel, which you have created in Aperture with an API key of <code>XXXXXX</code>, you would create the request as follows: </p> <pre><code> POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: indiepaper.io Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Authorization: Bearer XXXXXX x-indiepaper-destination: [aperture.p3k.io/micropub](https://aperture.p3k.io/micropub) url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509888/oumuamua-interstellar-comet-asteroid-solar-system-trajectory </code></pre> <p> When using Indiepaper&apos;s support for <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>, Indiepaper will request the <code>create</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>save</code> scopes. </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/indiepaper">Indiepaper is open source</a>, as is <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/Indiepaper-macOS">Indiepaper for macOS</a>. </p> </header> </section> </p>
