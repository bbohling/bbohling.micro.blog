It's true I may have a bit of a problem, but I love my Yeti gear. I haven't had any issues with their coolers, apparel, or drinkware...except for one. The Rambler 18oz bottle (2nd from left) is not great for coffee...it is just too messy. The ridge inside the bottle for the screw top causes coffee to go all over the place when pouring out...like into a small cup. OK, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but coffee absolutely drips down the side and it is frustrating. So unless you drink straight from it, which for me would only be pleasurable with a cold drink, I don't think it is as stellar as their other products. I have little doubt though that it will stop me from continuing to purchase their gear.
