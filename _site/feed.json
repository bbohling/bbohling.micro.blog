Though the Overnight Chocolate Coffee Chia Pudding recipe is a little finickyâ€¦chia seeds need to be distributed equally among the jars or they wonâ€™t set properly. Anyway, recommended for any foodieâ€¦even if you favor meat like me. :)</p>\n\n<p>The Food</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/e603c58642.jpg\"><img src=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/e603c58642.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/9f0ba9db21.jpg\"><img src=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/9f0ba9db21.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After using the InstantPot to make up a bag of black beans we made black bean burgers and black bean enchiladas from the bookâ€¦yummy!</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Itâ€™s true I may have a bit of a problem, but I love my Yeti gear. I havenâ€™t had any issues with their coolers, apparel, or drinkwareâ€¦except for one. The Rambler 18oz bottle (2nd from left) is not great for coffeeâ€¦it is just too messy. The ridge inside the bottle for the screw top causes coffee to go all over the place when pouring outâ€¦like into a small cup. OK, maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating a little bit, but coffee absolutely drips down the side and it is frustrating. So unless you drink straight from it, which for me would only be pleasurable with a cold drink, I donâ€™t think it is as stellar as their other products. I have little doubt though that it will stop me from continuing to purchase their gear.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/9825d5ea10.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n",
