The Rambler 18oz bottle (2nd from left) is not great for coffeeâ€¦it is just too messy. The ridge inside the bottle for the screw top causes coffee to go all over the place when pouring outâ€¦like into a small cup. OK, maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating a little bit, but coffee absolutely drips down the side and it is frustrating. So unless you drink straight from it, which for me would only be pleasurable with a cold drink, I donâ€™t think it is as stellar as their other products. I have little doubt though that it will stop me from continuing to purchase their gear.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://micro.brandonbohling.com/uploads/2018/9825d5ea10.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n",
